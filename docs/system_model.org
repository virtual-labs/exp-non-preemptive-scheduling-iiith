#+TITLE: System Model for Scheduling

** What all do we have in this system?
- A CPU
- A scheduler
- And a process queue

The CPU has absolutely no control over the process queue. It only has the control over the process it is currently running.

The scheduler is responsible in selecting a process from the process queue with a ready status and hand it over to the CPU. The process queue gets updated as the shceduler and CPU plays their respective roles.
One thing to note is that process queue is not a system like CPU or scheduler, but is a data structure that contains process info. 

Based on the above understanding, we can divide the system into 3 sub systems:
- Scheduler
- Environment 
- Plant

Scheduler is where we focus on scheduling mechanism along with it's related functions like identifying the ready process, and selecting one based on the algorithm.

Environment is where we have other user dependent functions like creating a process, requesting for IO, fulfilling the IO request and terminating a process.

Plant is where we see the changes in the system as a result of our actions performed as an external user and a scheduler.
