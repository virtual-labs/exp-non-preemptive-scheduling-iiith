#+TITLE: Conceptual Model for Scheduling

** Aim of the experiment
This experiment aims at bringing an in depth understanding of scheduling mechanism within the OS and to introduce the student to the ideology of viewing a system as a transitional state model with simply changes depending on the action taken by the user or any other internal actions.

** Pre-requisites needed
- Students are expected to know what a CPU is. 
- Students should be able to differentiate between different process states (ready, running, waiting, completed)

** Constraints/Barriers
- The simulation doesn't provide an opportunity to work with various scheduling algorithms.

** Outcomes of the experiment
    - Student would be able to understand how different actions changes the state of the system.
    - An high level abstract overview on how various subsystems interact in the scheduling mechanism.
    - Understanding how actions of states of processes and their run time is affected by scheduling.
