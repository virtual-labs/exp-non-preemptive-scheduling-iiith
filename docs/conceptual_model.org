#+TITLE: Conceptual Model for Scheduling

** Aim of the experiment
This experiment aims at creating an interactive and a student friendly simulation of the Scheduling machanism.

** Outcomes of the experiment
Understanding the mechanism of scheduling which includes
    - Understanding the process states
    - Understanding the transitions from one process state to another and how this impacts the scheduling mechanism.
    - Understanding how scheduler decides which process to choose (Scheduling mechanisms).
    - Understanding when a scheduler or the scheduling mechanism is triggered.

** High level overview of the mechanism
*** What all do we have in this mechanism?
- Processes in different states (Ready, Running, Waiting for IO, Terminated, Completed)
- CPU to execute the processes.
- Scheduler to schedule the processes.

*** Flow of the mechanism

*** When is the scheduling mechanism triggered?
- When a process in the CPU completes it's execution. (Software interrupt)
- When an external entity terminates the process. (Hardware interrupt)
