#+TITLE: Conceptual Model for Scheduling

** Aim of the experiment
This experiment aims at bringing an in depth understanding of scheduling mechanism within the OS and to introduce the student to the ideology of viewing a system as a transitional state model with simply changes depending on the action taken by the user or any other internal actions.
** Outcomes of the experiment
    - Student would be able to understand how different actions changes the state of the system.
    - An high level abstract overview on how various subsystems interact in the scheduling mechanism.
    - Understanding how actions of states of processes and their run time is affected by scheduling.
    
** High level overview of the mechanism
*** What all do we have in this mechanism?
- Processes in different states (Ready, Running, Waiting for IO, Terminated, Completed)
- CPU to execute the processes.
- Scheduler to schedule the processes.

*** Flow of the mechanism

*** When is the scheduling mechanism triggered?
- When a process in the CPU completes it's execution. (Software interrupt)
- When an external entity terminates the process. (Hardware interrupt)
