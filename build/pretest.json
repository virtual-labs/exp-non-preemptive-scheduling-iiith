        "a": "Whether or not a ready process can be involuntarily terminated",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation 1",
        "b": "Preemptive scheduling - Processor can be preempted to execute a different process in the middle of execution of any current process.Non-preemptive scheduling - Once a Processor starts to execute a process it must finish it before executing the other. It cannot be paused in the middle.",
